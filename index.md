## MiniMidi

A project between Thingking Studios and myself, to create a low-cost MIDI controller.

### Motivation and design

MIDI controllers are a key part of electronic music production. However, they can be expensive for someone starting out. 

The MiniMidi aims to solve that by keeping production costs low. There is no case, but rather the PCB itself serves both form _and_ function. The device uses the Arduino eco-system, such that the end-user can re-write the firmware if they wish to do so. The product was designed in KiCad.
